## AI vs Human Text Detector

A Streamlit application that analyzes text to determine whether it was written by a human or generated by an AI system. The project includes pre-trained machine learning models (SVM, Decision Tree, AdaBoost) and runs inside a development container for reproducible environments.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Single Detection**: Analyze individual text inputs (manual entry or file upload) to predict whether content is AI-generated or human-written.
- **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and process them in bulk, with progress tracking and downloadable CSV reports.
- **Model Comparison**: Run multiple models side-by-side on the same input, compare predictions and confidence scores visually.
- **Model Info**: View details about each available classifier (SVM, Decision Tree, AdaBoost) and the feature engineering approaches (TF-IDF, readability metrics, etc.).
- **Help & Troubleshooting**: Built-in help section with usage tips, common errors, and project structure overview.

## ðŸ›  Development Container Usage

This project is configured to run inside a development container using VS Code Remote Containers or GitHub Codespaces:

1. **Prerequisites**

   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
   - Docker installed and running

2. **Open in Container**

   - Clone the repository locally:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<username>/ai_detection_app.git
     cd ai_detection_app
     ```
   - In VS Code, open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...**
   - Choose this project folder. VS Code will build the Docker image based on `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` and attach to the container.
